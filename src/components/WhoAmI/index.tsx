      <h3>Vincent Jacquelin</h3>
      <p>
        I’m currently completing a six-month internship at Liv-n, an innovative
        startup in the real estate management sector, as part of my final
        project for a Bachelor’s-level (Bac +3/4) web development degree. I
        joined the team with a real challenge: learning PHP and the CodeIgniter
        framework (v3 & v4) on my own in order to contribute to their fullstack
        project — a challenge all the more exciting as I had just finished a
        React training program, which I personally financed through a loan and
        completed with Le Réacteur. Impressed by my dedication and abilities,
        the team at Liv-n later entrusted me with the frontend mobile
        development of their application, using React Native for both Android
        and iOS platforms. My passion for programming began during an initial
        training in web design. Since then, my interest in interface design and
        smooth user experiences has only grown. That’s why today, I’m looking to
        join a tech team in the Lyon area as a frontend developer. Driven,
        self-taught, and team-oriented, I put just as much care into writing
        clean code as I do into building strong, positive relationships.
